            <h6>STEP 1</h6>

            Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base of two 18cm sandwich tins. Sieve the flour, cocoa powder and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix well.
            
            <h6>STEP 2</h6>

            Make a well in the centre and add the golden syrup, eggs, sunflower oil and milk. Beat well with an electric whisk until smooth.
            
            <h6>STEP 3</h6>

            Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and firm to the touch. Remove from oven, leave to cool for 10 mins before turning out onto a cooling rack.
            
            <h6>STEP 4</h6>

            To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl until soft. Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then add enough of the milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.
            
            <h6>STEP 5</h6>

            Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover the sides and the top of the cake with more icing.</p>

        <p>      
            <h6>STEP 1</h6>


            Heat the olive oil in a large pan and cook the chopped onion, garlic and chopped celery for 3-4 minutes over a medium heat until the onion has softened slightly. Tip in the lean minced beef and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes until browned all over. Stir in the sun-dried tomato paste and cook for 1 minute.
            
            <h6>STEP 2</h6>

            Add the chopped tomatoes. Pour the beef stock into the empty tomato can, swish around then add to the pan. Stir in the pitted black chopped olives. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat, then cover and simmer gently for 35-40 minutes, until very tender. Season well and stir in a handful of fresh torn basil leaves.
            
            <h6>STEP 3</h6>

            Toss with cooked spaghetti and serve.</p>
